 Project Showcase: Web-Based Calculator

I built a responsive and user-friendly web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, especially in handling DOM manipulation and designing clean, intuitive UI/UX.

Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)

Clear and Delete functionalities

Keyboard input support

Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

This project reflects my growing interest in web development and hands-on application of core programming concepts. I'm excited to keep building and learning more!
